The HTTP endpoints to support this game will look like this:

POST to /start_game  âˆ†
This request begins a game. The response says Good luck! and starts a game.

GET to /game
A request to this verb/path combo tells us:

a) how many guesses have been taken.
b) if a guess has been made, it tells what the guess was and whether it was too
high, too low, or correct

POST to /game
This is how we make a guess. The request includes a parameter named guess.
The server stores the guess and sends the user a redirect response, causing the
client to make a GET to /game.
